## Reflection

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make my programs maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I prioritize clear structure, consistent naming, modular design, and thorough documentation. When building the CRUD Python module in Project One, I focused on creating separate, reusable methods for create, read, update, and delete operations. This approach made it easier to connect the module to the interactive dashboard in Project Two without major rewrites. The advantage was that I could rapidly test different dashboard components without needing to change the database logic. In the future, I could reuse or expand this CRUD module in other applications that interact with MongoDB, simply by updating the collection or query parameters.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem, I break it into smaller steps, analyze the requirements carefully, and plan the overall structure before coding. For example, when Grazioso Salvare requested specific dashboard features like interactive filters and geolocation charts, I first outlined how the data needed to flow between MongoDB and the dashboard. Compared to earlier courses, I was much more deliberate about planning the backend (CRUD module) and frontend (Dash dashboard) together. In the future, I would continue to start with clear user requirements, sketch out the needed queries and visualizations, and build databases with scalability and usability in mind.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing, building, and maintaining efficient systems and applications. Our work is important because businesses, nonprofits, and governments rely on technology for everything from operations to decision-making. In this project, my dashboard would help Grazioso Salvare quickly access and analyze data about rescue animals, saving time and improving their ability to match animals with training programs. By developing tools like this, computer scientists help organizations work smarter, serve clients better, and make a greater impact.
